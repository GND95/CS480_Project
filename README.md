**Purpose:**<br/>
“Teacher troubleshooting application” I created during my time as an intern at a school district. This application utilizes a custom-made database I created to interface with the program. This program incorporates email functionality in addition to a form allowing full edit and search functions to the database. This program made it much easier to find phone extensions and locations for various faculty members of the school district. 

This program was created as a school project where the thesis was to design a piece of software to improve the efficiency of our current job.

**Video demonstration**<br/> 
Video demonstration of this project for my capstone course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX_qCWDHxtc Project for one of my final computer science classes. I must design a program that will help with a problem that is identified at our current job.
